CajuScan is a mobile Android application, developed in Flutter, that simplifies expense recording in Portugal.
The app allows you to scan the QR Code (ATCUD) present on Portuguese invoices, automatically extract transaction data, and send it to the financial management app Cashew.

The goal is to automate the manual process of entering expenses, saving time and reducing errors.

Features:
 - Scan ATCUD QR Codes from Portuguese invoices
 - Automatic data extraction (amount, date, vendor, etc.)
 - Integration with the Cashew app for financial tracking
 - Simple, usability-focused interface

Developed with privacy in mind: no tracking, no ads, no data sent to external servers.
